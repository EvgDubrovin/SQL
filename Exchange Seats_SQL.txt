Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

table Seat:
id | student		id | student			
-------------	--->	-------------
 1 | Abbott		 1 | Doris
 2 | Doris		 2 | Abbott
 3 | Emerson		 3 | Green
 4 | Green		 4 | Emerson
 5 | Jeames		 5 | Jeames

SELECT CASE
    	WHEN (id % 2 = 1) AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id
	WHEN (id % 2 = 1) THEN id + 1
	WHEN (id % 2 = 0) THEN id - 1
       END AS id,
       student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
;
