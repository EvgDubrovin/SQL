Calculate each user's average session time. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.

facebook_web_log:
user_id | timestamp | action
........|...........|.........


Workflow:
1. Select earliest page exit by client.
2. Add latest page load by client.
3. Calculate average session time as difference between #1 and #2.
